Component library for compatible tools, and templates for PowerBI.

### Introduction - https://www.openxbi.com.br/docs/introduction
(OpenXBI) Open - New UX for BI - It is a concept that refers to the creation of more open and collaborative user experiences (UX) for Business Intelligence (BI). In other words, it means that BI components must be designed to allow greater user interaction and participation throughout the data analysis process.

### Vision
As an HTML and CSS component platform, we aim to provide a set of user interface (UI) components for data analysis. These components are designed to be flexible and highly customizable, allowing users to adapt the interface to their specific needs.

Styling components in HTML and CSS and allowing the incorporation of the DAX language in their operation are the main differentials that we seek to offer to users. Our goal is to provide highly customizable and useful components while addressing accessibility issues common in BI solutions.

### Getting Started - https://www.openxbi.com.br/docs/getting-started
Complete tutorial on how to use OpenXBI components.
Knowledge of DAX measures, HTML, and CSS may be optional for component usage, but modifying and adapting to your dashboard may require more advanced knowledge. We have highlighted the main points of the components to assist with editing.



## Main features
**Dynamism** - Some important elements of PowerBI, for example, are somewhat static, and do not have agile interactivity to bring new information, such as the "Card or CartÃ£o", thinking about it, we created Cards that have interactivity when hovering the mouse over it, bringing new information or even graphs instantly.

**Accessibility** - We can say that PowerBI is a tool with several accessibility functions, but still some elements leave something to be desired, especially when it comes to Cards and focus on elements. We seek to develop elements that stand out and help with visualization, whether for users with eye damage or for those who do a lot of presentations with a dashboard.

**Comments** - We seek to comment on the most important and modified parts of a component to help our users during edits or even understand how the component works.

**DAX** - As mentioned during the introduction, incorporating DAX is the main feature, which we seek to pass on knowledge to users, it is with it that you will be able to do magic with the components. Formatting values, calculating, creating conditionals or iterating, are some of the functions that you can find preconfigured in our templates.
